       <h3>Steps</h3>

       <ol>
           <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over
            medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, toamto paste,
            tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, italian
            seasoning, 1 tsp salt, pepper, and 2 tbsp parsley. Simmer,
            covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
           </li>
           <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in 
            boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with colde 
            water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, reamaining
            parsley, and 1/2 tsp salt. 
           </li>
           <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
           <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/12 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13
            inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread
            with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella
            cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzerella, and sprinkle 
            with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking,
            either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch 
            the cheese. 
            </li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an 
                additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
